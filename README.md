# AspNetCore2CoreUI

This repo contains a standard ASP.NET MVC Core 2 Visual Studio 2017 template project with a twist.

The [CoreUI Open Source Bootstrap 4 Admin Template](http://coreui.io/) was adapted to replace the default style, to get a good starting point for an elegant solution in your next project.

This repo goes along with my blog post [Construyendo aplicaciones elegantes con ASP.NET MVC Core 2 y Bootstrap 4 usando CoreUI](http://www.coderepo.blog/posts/construyendo-aplicaciones-elegantes-aspnet-mvc-core-2-bootstrap-4-coreui/) (in spanish)

In the blog post I explain tha tasks to adapt the [CoreUI](http://coreui.io/) template, getting acquainted with [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) and [Gulp](https://gulpjs.com/) in the process.

I consider this a stepping stone on my way to Javascript front end development, coming from a C# backend background.

Hope this can help you too on your way to become a better developer.
